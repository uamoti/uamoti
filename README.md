Hi there üëã

How nice of you to visit üòÉ

I'm a biomedical researcher on my way to backend developer. Pythonist at heart with skills in R, SQL and MongoDB.
Linux user for 10+ years and always trying to learn something new.

At the moment, I'm working as a post-doctoral researcher at UEF ‚ùÑÔ∏è - leukaemia and ncRNAs.
I've also just started as a student at [kood/Sisu](https://koodsisu.fi) üíú, where we combine Go and JavaScript to bake fullstack developers.
