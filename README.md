Hi there,

How nice of you to visit!

I'm a biomedical researcher with a flare for programming and development. Pythonist at heart with skills in R and some DB.
Linux user for 10+ years and always trying to learn something new.

Currently working as a post-doctoral fellow at UEF.

I'm looking forward to moving into development, science-related or not.
Open for any kind of collaboration where I can be of help.


Towards the stars!
