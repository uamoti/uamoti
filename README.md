Hi there,

How nice of you to visit!

I'm Bernardo, a biomedical researcher with a flare for data and programming. Pythonist at heart with skills in R, SQL and MongoDB.
Linux user for 10+ years and always trying to learn something new.

Currently working as a post-doctoral fellow at [CSBL](https://www.csbiology.org) exploring smartwatch data.

I'm looking forward to move into more computational work, science-related or not.
Open for any kind of collaboration where I can be of help.

You can reach me here any time.

Towards the stars!
