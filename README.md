Hi there,

How nice of you to visit!

I'm @uamoti, a biomedical researcher with some skills in Python, R and SQL. Linux user for the past decade or so and always trying to learn something new.
I'm looking forward to move into more computational work, science-related or not.

Open for any kind of collaboration where I can be of help.

You can reach me here any time.

Towards the stars!
